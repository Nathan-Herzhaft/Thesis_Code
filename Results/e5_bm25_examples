e5 fail examples :
- Focus on specific words it has not seen before (Like "What is xxx ?"). Seems like bm25 doesn't "understand" novel words but recognizes them and find co-occurences, e5 can't adapt to what it doesn't know.
- Mistakes and typos, e5 focuses on something that appears as a new word while it can be irrelevant ("aare", possibly double spaces, ...)

bm25 fail examples :
- Focus on words co-occurences even when not relevant (Like pronouns, adverbs, ...)
- Implicit meaning in the question to find the right pasage ("What do arrows indicate on Figure 1?", "what is the observed benefit of this molecule ?")

Both succeed examples :
- Clear questions with known key words (like virus, vaccine, ...) and useful context words (improvement, model, isloated, ...)

Both fail examples :
- Other occurences of "What is xxx ?" type questions
- Vague questions like "What is this study about ?"
